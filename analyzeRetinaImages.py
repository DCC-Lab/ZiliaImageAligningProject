1. Find the ONH in the picture (will most likely have a minimum brightness
and size)
2. Approximate it as an ellipse
3. Use the middle of this ellipse to determine the reference point for the
first picture, and the shift for the subsequent pictures.
4. Discard images if the ONH is not found (retina AND related rosa images).
